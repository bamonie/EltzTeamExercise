I Threw a Apfelkuchen at the Porshe. The Porshe sped off towards Berlin, with a BWM tailing it. The Porshe driver dropped his Bratwurst after crossing the Hauptstrasse. The BMW driver went to the Biergarten for a drink. Inside the Porsche was the band Rammstein, on the way to the Flughafen. All of the band members wore Lederhose, and decided to stop and see Eltz before continuing.
